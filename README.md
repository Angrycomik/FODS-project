# FODS-project

This is my report for the Fundamentals of Data Science course.

The goal of the project was to process and analyze a Fashion MNIST dataset by addressing the following tasks and questions:

• Do the summary of the data and discuss it.

• Reduce data dimensionality

• Visualize the reduced dataset

• Cluster the dataset (and evaluate clustering results with classification labels). Do we have some
outliers here?

• Split the dataset into training and testing.

• Perform classification and evaluate its result.

I explored different clustering and classification algorithms, comparing their performance on image recognition tasks. 

The report documents results and conclusions from my work.
